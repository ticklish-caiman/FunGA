"In life sciences, funga is a recent term for the kingdom fungi similar to the longstanding fauna for animals and flora for plants."

But in this app FunGA stands for Fun with Genetic Algorithms!
An awesome way to understand the coding techniques inspired by Darwinian natural selection.

# The plan
Must-haves:

    • easy to use web interface in Streamlit
    • some theory - necessary boring part
    • some practice - awesome fun part, interactive GA
 

Should-haves:


    • basic optimization - caching and maybe some JS magic
    • unit tests

Could-haves:


    • some database solution for saving and loading experiments
    • other fun topics like Conway's Game of life
    • Neural-Networks also would be NEAT ;) 
    • Second language

Won't-haves:


    • Integrated chat-bot
    • Loot-boxes
    • Micro-transactions

Possible problems:
</p>
    
    • Streamlit may not be enough for some functionality - switching to other library may be necessary
      UPDATE: Pure Python approach is nice, all seems easy at first, 
      but the lack of robust native support for persistent client-side storage is a valid limitation of Streamlit.
      I am also not a fan of top-down refreshes on almost every action.
      Well... let's look for different library.
