                # Examples
                # --------
                # Create a callback that forwards its first parameter to a session state item called "data":
                # >>> editor.Monaco(onChange=sync("data"))
                # >>> print(st.session_state.data)
                #
                # Create a callback that forwards its second parameter to a session state item called "ev":
                # >>> editor.Monaco(onChange=sync(None, "ev"))
                # >>> print(st.session_state.ev)
                #
                # Create a callback that forwards both of its parameters to session state:
                # >>> editor.Monaco(onChange=sync("data", "ev"))
                # >>> print(st.session_state.data)
                # >>> print(st.session_state.ev)
                #
                # Now, there is an issue: onChange is called everytime a change is made, which means everytime
                # you type a single character, your entire Streamlit app will rerun.
                #
                # To avoid this issue, you can tell Streamlit Elements to wait for another event to occur
                # (like a button click) to send the updated data, by wrapping your callback with lazy().
