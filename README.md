But in this app FunGA stands for Fun with Genetic Algorithms!
An awesome way to understand the coding techniques inspired by Darwinian natural selection.

# The plan
<p align="justify">
Must-haves:
</p>

    • easy to use web interface in Streamlit
    • some theory - necessary boring part
    • some practice - awesome fun part, interactive GA
 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Should-haves:
</p>

    • basic optimization - caching and maybe some JS magic
    • unit tests
</p>
Could-haves:
</p>

    • some database solution for saving and loading experiments
    • other fun topics like Conway's Game of life
    • Neural-Networks also would be NEAT ;) 
</p>
Won't-haves:
</p>

    • Integrated chat-bot
    • Loot-boxes
    • Micro-transactions
</p>

Possible problems:
</p>
    
    • Streamlit may not be enough for some functionality - switching to other library may be necessary
